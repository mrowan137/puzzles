# Puzzles

Collection of worked puzzles, for recreation, self-study, and learning.


## Description

As a longtime puzzler who gets a lot of enjoyment out of creative problem
solving, this is a place for me to compile various problems I've worked on:

* [leetcode](https://github.com/mrowan137/puzzles/blob/main/leetcode): problems
  from the classic coding puzzles website
  [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/).
* [project_euler](https://github.com/mrowan137/puzzles/blob/main/project_euler):
  challenging mathematical and computational problems that exercise creative
  problem solving and programming skills,
  [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
* [misc](https://github.com/mrowan137/puzzles/blob/main/misc): these are from
  various sources, including online forums, blogs, and discussions with friends.
