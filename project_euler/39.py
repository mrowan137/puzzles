Q: If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
{a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

A: 840
"""

# constraints:
#   1. p = a + b + c --> c = a + b - p --> c^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2*p*(a + b) + p^2
#   2. c^2 = a^2 + b^2
#
# combine gives:
#   a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2*p*(a + b) + p^2
#           0 = 2*a*b - 2*p*(a + b) + p^2
#
# Solutions are:
#   p = (a + b) +/- sqrt( (a + b)^2 - 2*a*b )
#     = (a + b) +/- sqrt( a^2 + b^2 )
#
# Reject the '-' root because the perimeter will be larger than a + b.
# So the question can be rephrased as, which value of p admits
# the greatest number of solutions, where 3 <= p <= 1000
# and a and b are positive integers.
# Counting strategy is to iterate through valid values of a, b
# and increment the count of number of solutions.
